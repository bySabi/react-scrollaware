# a React scroll-aware Higher-order Component
A React HoC component for create scroll-aware wrapped components. Works in all containers that can scroll, including the window.

> The intended purpouse of this component is abstract a well tested scroll event handler and build complex scroll behaviour on top of it.

## Troubleshooting
If your component isn't working the way you expect it to. Clone and modify the project locally.
- clone this repo
- add `console.log` or breakpoints where you think it would be useful.
- `npm link` in the react-scrollaware repo.
- `npm link react-scrollaware` in your project.
- if needed rebuild react-scrollaware module: `npm run build-npm`
